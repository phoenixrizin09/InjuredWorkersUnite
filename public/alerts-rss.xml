      <title>Community Discussion: Question for PC Voters about RTO/WFH</title>
      <description>I&apos;m curious to hear from PC voters and even some more conservative Liberal voters about their views on RTO (Return to Office) and WFH (Work from Home) as well as a more broad question at the end.

  
If a party other than the Conservatives were to introduce a policy in their campaign which made working from home a protected labour right if the job can be provably and demonstrably done from home, would that be an engaging policy in your opinion?

I know that the discussions around RTO/WFH have so</description>

      <title>New Federal Data: Wages </title>
      <description>The wages on the Job Bank website are specific to an occupation and provide information on the earnings of workers at the regional level. Wages for most occupations are also provided at the national and provincial level. In Canada, all jobs are associated with one specific occupational grouping which is determined by the National Occupational Classification. For most occupations, a minimum, median and maximum wage estimates are displayed. They are update annually.

      <title>Community Discussion: Telus employee fell in my yard</title>
      <description>A Telus employee came to my door and said they had to gain access to my yard to go up a pole in my yard (for some random customers ticket, not ours). This isn’t unusual, they asked if they could go in my yard through my gate and I said yes. For what it’s worth I do have cameras in the front, side and back that are motion activated and have video of them asking for permission. 7 minutes later they fell off their ladder and they called 911 which we only realized when our notifications went crazy o</description>

      <title>Community Discussion: I’m getting concerned I will never be able to return back to my pre-injury job.</title>
      <description>I suffered a workplace injury about 9 months ago, where I was immediately receiving WSIB for.  For reference, I suffered from a knee subluxation that doesn’t seem to be recovering very well.
I have been able to do modified duties for the last 4 months, however my employer claims there is nothing for me, and they expect me to come back to my full capabilities to the job I was hired for.
I never passed probation and was only days away from passing my training.  I was there almost 5 weeks before I </description>

      <title>New Federal Data: Occupational injuries</title>
      <description>The dataset shows claims for occupational injuries registered in one calendar year and admitted no later than March 1 of the following year. 

Occupational injuries are recorded in CNESST systems following the receipt of claims.

These claims represent workers who were covered by the occupational health and safety insurance plan for which the CNESST is responsible.

The _Law on Industrial Accidents and Occupational Diseases_ (LATMP) aims to compensate for occupational injuries and the cons</description>
