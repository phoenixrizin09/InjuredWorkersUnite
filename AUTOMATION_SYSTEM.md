# AUTOMATED INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM - ACTIVATED

## Overview
The website now features a **fully integrated automation system** that connects all four intelligence gathering tools into a unified, self-operating network.

## System Components

### 1. **The EYE** (Pattern Detection)
- **Auto-scanning**: Every 5 minutes across all scopes (Local/Provincial/Federal)
- **Categories**: Monitors 11 issue areas automatically
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects anomalies, policy changes, and systemic issues
- **Auto-escalation**: Critical findings automatically become alerts

### 2. **Automated Monitoring** (Target Tracking)
- **Entity Tracking**: Monitors specific organizations, politicians, corporations
- **Source Integration**: Legislative databases, court filings, corporate records
- **Real-time Updates**: Checks tracked targets every 30 seconds
- **Evidence Collection**: Automatically gathers and timestamps evidence

### 3. **Alerts** (Real-time Notifications)
- **Instant Alerts**: Critical findings trigger immediate notifications
- **Live Updates**: Refreshes every 5 seconds
- **Severity Filtering**: Critical, High, Warning, Info levels
- **Action Buttons**: Pre-configured response actions for each alert

### 4. **Target Acquisition** (Dossier Building)
- **Auto-detection**: When The EYE identifies suspicious entities
- **Evidence Compilation**: Automatically builds comprehensive dossiers
- **Relationship Mapping**: Tracks connections between targets
- **Threat Assessment**: Automatic threat level calculation

## Master Control

### Location
**The EYE page** (`/the-eye`) features the **AUTOMATED INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM** control panel at the top.

### Activation
1. Click **"▶️ ACTIVATE AUTOMATION"** to enable full system
2. All four components begin coordinating automatically
3. Status displays:
   - 📊 Active Alerts count
   - 🎯 Tracked Targets count
   - 🔍 Last Scan timestamp

### Deactivation
- Click **"⏸️ DEACTIVATE AUTOMATION"** to pause all systems
- Manual operation still available when deactivated

## Cross-System Coordination

### Workflow
```
The EYE (Scans) → Identifies Patterns
      ↓
Monitoring (Tracks) → Follows Specific Entities
      ↓
Target Acquisition (Builds) → Compiles Dossiers
      ↓
Alerts (Notifies) → Real-time Warnings
```

### Data Flow
1. **The EYE** performs automated scans every 5 minutes
2. Detected patterns are analyzed for severity and relevance
3. **Critical findings** automatically:
   - Generate alerts in Alerts page
   - Add entities to Target Acquisition tracking
   - Begin monitoring in Monitoring system
4. **Evidence collection** happens automatically:
   - Government records scraped
   - Court case monitoring
   - Legislative change tracking
   - Corporate filing analysis

## Automation Engine

### Technical Details
- **Location**: `/utils/automation-engine.js`
- **Storage**: localStorage for persistence across sessions
- **State Management**: Singleton pattern for unified state
- **Event System**: Real-time listeners for cross-component updates

### Data Persistence
- **Automation State**: Stores on/off status, auto-start preference
- **Active Alerts**: All current and historical alerts
- **Tracked Targets**: Complete target list with evidence
- **Scan History**: Last 100 scans with findings

### Alert Generation
Alerts are triggered when:
- Severity is "critical"
- Confidence level > 90%
- Tracked target is mentioned
- Pattern matches known issues

## Features

### Real-time Capabilities
- **5-minute scan cycles** on The EYE
- **30-second target checks** in Monitoring
- **5-second alert updates** on Alerts page
- **10-second tracking updates** on Target Acquisition

### Evidence-Based
- All insights include source links
- Government records cited
- Timestamps on all findings
- Verification paths provided

### Automatic Actions
- **Critical Severity**: Instant alert + target tracking + monitoring activation
- **High Severity**: Alert + monitoring recommendation
- **Warning/Info**: Logged for analysis, no immediate action

## User Benefits

### Passive Intelligence
- Set it and forget it - automation runs 24/7
- Wake up to fresh insights every day
- No manual searching required
- Comprehensive coverage across all jurisdictions

### Actionable Intelligence
- Pre-written action plans for each finding
- Evidence packages ready to share
- Media dossiers prepared
- Legal complaint templates

### Coordination
- All systems work together automatically
- No need to manually cross-reference
- Unified tracking across tools
- Seamless data flow

## Security & Privacy

### Data Storage
- **Local only**: All data stored in browser localStorage
- **No server uploads**: Nothing sent to external servers
- **User control**: Can clear data anytime
- **Session persistence**: Survives page refreshes

### Source Transparency
- Every insight links to original sources
- Government records are public
- Verification paths clearly marked
- No speculation - only documented facts

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- RSS feed integration for news monitoring
- GitHub Actions for scheduled external scans
- Webhook support for external alert systems
- Export/import functionality for sharing intelligence
- Collaborative tracking lists
- API endpoints for third-party integration

### Expansion Possibilities
- Natural language processing for pattern detection
- Machine learning for threat assessment
- Network graph visualization of relationships
- Predictive analytics for policy changes
- Integration with legal case management systems
