```

### 2. Outrage/Anger (Validated Emotion)
```
They denied {NUMBER} claims in ONE week. The reason? You won't believe it. 🧵
CEO salary: ${CEO_SALARY}. Your maximum benefit: ${BENEFIT}. Any questions?
They rejected a claim in 48 hours but take 18 MONTHS to hear an appeal. Coincidence?
```

### 3. Solidarity/Community
```
Every injured worker who's been told "it's in your head" 🤝 We see you.
Thread: Real stories from {NUMBER} workers denied this month. You're not alone. 🧵
To everyone still fighting after months (or years) of appeals: We're with you. ✊
```

### 4. Curiosity/Mystery
```
We ran the numbers on {AGENCY}. What we found will shock you. 🧵
There's a pattern they don't want you to notice. Here's what The Eye found:
Why do 67% of {TYPE} claims get denied? The answer isn't what you think...
```

### 5. Educational/Value
```
5 things you MUST document right now if you're filing a claim (thread):

### 6. Bold Statement
```
The workers' comp system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed. Thread 🧵
They don't deny claims to save money. They deny claims to make you give up.
Hot take: The 18-month wait for appeals isn't a bug, it's a feature.
```
