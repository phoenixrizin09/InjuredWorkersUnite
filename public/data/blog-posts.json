    "content": "In an age of misinformation, we make one ironclad promise: ZERO MOCK DATA.\n\n## The Problem with Mock Data\n\nMany activist sites use \"sample data\" or \"example statistics.\" This:\n- Undermines credibility\n- Weakens legal arguments\n- Gives opponents ammunition\n- Betrays community trust\n\n## Our Standard\n\nEvery number, every story, every statistic comes from:\n\n1. **Government APIs** (4 sources, all free):\n   - open.canada.ca - Federal datasets\n   - data.ontario.ca - Provincial data\n   - openparliament.ca - Bills and debates\n   - reddit.com - Real community discussions\n\n2. **Verification Requirements**:\n   - Must link to original source\n   - Must include timestamp\n   - Must be publicly accessible\n   - Must update automatically\n\n3. **Transparency Measures**:\n   - All source code public on GitHub\n   - Data fetch logs visible\n   - API endpoints documented\n   - Cost always displayed ($0.00)\n\n## Current Data Stats\n\nAs of today:\n- **89 government datasets** actively monitored\n- **24 Reddit posts** from real injured workers\n- **20 Parliament bills** tracked\n- **12 active alerts** generated\n- **Updates**: Every 6 hours automatically\n- **Cost**: $0.00 (all APIs free)\n\n## How to Verify\n\nDon't trust us—verify yourself:\n\n1. Visit /alerts to see real-time data\n2. Click any source link to see original\n3. Check data-summary.json for timestamps\n4. Review our GitHub repository\n5. Run fetch scripts yourself\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nWhen you share our content, you're sharing FACTS, not opinions. When you cite our data, you're citing GOVERNMENT SOURCES, not activist claims.\n\nThis is why The Eye works. This is why we win.\n\nTruth is our weapon. Verification is our shield.",

Auto-Fetch Data (Every 6 Hours)\n```yaml\nschedule:\n  - cron: \"0 */6 * * *\"  # Every 6 hours\n```\n\n**What it does**:\n- Fetches 89 government datasets\n- Collects 24+ Reddit discussions\n- Tracks 20 Parliament bills\n- Generates 12 real-time alerts\n- Updates all JSON files\n\n### 2. Auto-Generate Content\n- Daily blog posts\n- Weekly Eye Oracle reports\n- Viral meme content from real data\n- Dynamic sitemap\n- 3 RSS feeds\n\n### 3. Auto-Deploy Changes\n- Builds static site\n- Runs tests\n- Deploys to Cloudflare Pages\n- Updates within minutes\n\n## Cost: $0.00\n\nGitHub Actions provides:\n- 2,000 free minutes/month (private repos)\n- Unlimited for public repos\n- No credit card required\n- Enterprise-grade reliability\n\nOur usage: ~30 minutes/day = 100% free\n\n## Impact\n\n**Before automation**:\n- Manual updates took 2 hours/day\n- Data often stale\n- Human errors common\n- Limited scalability\n\n**After automation**:\n- Zero manual intervention\n- Data always fresh (max 6 hours old)\n- Perfect consistency\n- Scales infinitely\n\n## Lessons for Activists\n\nYou don't need expensive infrastructure to fight power. Free tools can:\n- Level the playing field\n- Sustain long-term campaigns\n- Scale without funding\n- Maintain 24/7 operations\n\n## Open Source\n\nOur entire automation setup is public:\n- `.github/workflows/` directory\n- All scripts documented\n- Copy and adapt freely\n- No permission needed\n\nThis is digital activism in 2025: automated, verified, unstoppable.",

No corporate partnerships. No compromises.\n\n## For Other Activists\n\nSetup Brave Rewards:\n1. Sign up: creators.brave.com\n2. Add verification file to your site\n3. Wait for approval\n4.
